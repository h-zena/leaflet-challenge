# leaflet-challenge

This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides earthquake data in GeoJSON format, updated every 5 minutes. This project fetches earthquake data from the USGS API and plots it on an interactive map using Leaflet. Each earthquake is represented by a marker on the map, with the marker's size indicating the earthquake's magnitude. I selected all earthquakes from the last 7 days.
